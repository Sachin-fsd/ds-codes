| **Concatenate**         | O(n + m)                | O(n + m)                 | Concatenation involves copying both `str1` and `str2`, where `n` and `m` represent their lengths.                    | A new string of size `n + m` is created to hold the combined result.      |
| **Substring**           | O(k)                    | O(k)                     | Extracting a substring of length `k` requires copying `k` characters from the original string.                       | Memory is needed to store the substring of length `k`.                    |
| **Compare Strings**     | O(min(n, m))            | O(1)                     | The comparison stops at the first mismatch or at the end of the shorter string, where `n` and `m` are their lengths. | Only constant space is used for the comparison.                           |
| **Character Frequency** | O(n)                    | O(n)                     | Traversing the string `str` of length `n` while updating a `HashMap` takes linear time.                              | The `HashMap` can require up to `O(n)` space if each character is unique. |

## Explanation:
1. **Concatenate**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n + m)` as both strings need to be copied into a new string.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n + m)` due to the new string that combines `str1` and `str2`.

2. **Substring**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(k)` for copying `k` characters from the source string.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` for storing the extracted substring.

3. **Compare Strings**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(min(n, m))`, since the operation stops at the first differing character or the end of the shorter string.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as no additional data structures are needed.

4. **Character Frequency**:
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` because the string is processed once, updating a `HashMap` for each character.
   - **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` in the worst case, as the `HashMap` might store up to `n` unique characters.
